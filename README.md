Below is the explination of what I've done for this homework. 

I've added my own commentary for the files, so it would be easier to navigate, both for myself and the viewer(employer).

Under index, line  12 and 35: i've changed the (div) to its own section for ease to review the file and knowing what each location is for. 

For the header name Horiseon, did not see a point for there to be a seperate class for "seo" the only noticable difference or funcationality for those three letters was the unnoticable color difference, but I removed it because it seems unnecessary.

Line 19-34, ive updated the div to a <nav> and added the <ul> to show that it is a listed informaiton.  I've also added the benefits list because that seemed to be important for the viewers to know.  Overall, made the code easier to read.

 I've seperated the class hero, made its own section to be used as background, also the alt was added.  this way, if we need to change the image or add anything to it, it will be easily detected.

 Under the content section: I've made sure that each section had their own article and keep to themselves. Under the .CSS I've made it that the class is following one specific look, rather than having multiple classes with the same look, this reduces the space and helps with tracking

 Same with benefits section, instead of having different .css for the look of the benefits, i made it that each benefit is following a specific guidline on how it looks.  thus reducing the space in .css file.  Also under the .css, i've made it that the border matches the size of the other listed items, so now it doesn't awkwardly look out of place.

 Footer, was not included on the screenshot of how it should look like, so I added it's own border and arranged the location of the inc.  if needed, could easily add the privacy policy section and continued with additional formatting if requested.
